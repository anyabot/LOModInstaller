# Overview 
A simple APK to quickly apply Mods for the game Last Origin.

Require Android version 7 or above. Tested and working for Android 12 and some Android 13.

With [Shizuku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api&hl=en&gl=US) installed, the app can also use ADB to install patches for Android 11 to 14.

This project is experimental, and game patching is not supported by developers. 

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
# Usage

  * (For Android 13) Tap **GRANT PERMISSION** for the game version you're using, then **USE THIS FOLDER** to allow access to Android Storage. 
    * The switches for versions of the Game should be toggleale now.
  * (For Shizuku) See [this](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/) for Shizuku's setup guide. 
    * Start Shizuku (this must be done each time).
    * Open the LO Mod Installer and tap **GRANT SHIZUKU PERMISSION** (this only needs to be done once).

# Attentions
* Experimental, might not work on some phones. Contact me on Discord (Altter#7252) if you encounter any errors.
* Make sure to let the game download all its assets before patching.
  * Weekly updates might cause some of the files to be replaced. You can use the APK to apply Mods again.
* The folders inside the Mod Folder should have the correct name corresponding to the one to be replaced inside **/files/UnityCache/Shared** folder.
* The asset must be named **__data**. It must also be at most 1 subfolder deep inside the Mod folder.
  * For example, both **Mod Folder/localization/__data** and **Mod Folder/localization/gibberish/__data** will correcty place the mod inside **localization** folder, but not **Mod Folder/localization/gibberish/gibberish 2/__data**
* (For Android 10 or above) There must be only one subfolder inside the modded folder, **__data** must also exist already inside that folder.
* If anything break, delete the modded folders inside **/files/UnityCache/Shared**, then reopen the game to download assets again.
