# Attentions
* Make sure to let the game download all its assets before patching.
  * Weekly updates might cause some of the files to be replaced. You can use the APK to apply Mods again.
* The folders inside the Mod Folder should have the correct name corresponding to the one to be replaced inside **/files/UnityCache/Shared** folder.
* The asset must be named **__data**. It must also be at most 1 subfolder deep inside the Mod folder.
  * For example, both **Mod Folder/localization/__data** and **Mod Folder/localization/gibberish/__data** will correcty place the mod inside **localization** folder, ut not **Mod Folder/localization/gibberish/gibberish 2/__data**
* (For Android 10 or above) There must be only one subfolder inside the modded folder, **__data** must also exist already inside that folder.
* If anything break, delete the modded folders inside **/files/UnityCache/Shared**, then reopen the game to download assets again.
